# Mana Kirana (మన కిరాణా / हमारा किराना) — AI-Powered Smart Local Commerce

> **"Find what you need from your local shops — just ask."**  
> *"మీ దగ్గర్లోని దుకాణాలలో మీకు కావాల్సిన సరుకులు వెతకండి — అడగండి చాలు."*  
> *"अपनी पास की दुकान से जो चाहिए खोजें — बस बोलिए या पूछिए।"*

**Mana Kirana** connects neighborhood kirana and general stores with nearby customers. Small retailers can digitize their inventory, track customer Khata (udhar/jama), and log daily expenses using natural voice or text in **Telugu, Hindi, or English** without complicated software. Nearby customers can ask for multi-item grocery baskets by typing or speaking naturally and discover which store has all requested items at the lowest total basket price.

## 🌟 Key Highlights & Real-World Features

1. **🎙️ Real Working Voice Recognition & Audio Feedback**
   - Direct Web Speech API integration in both **Customer Search** and **Shopkeeper Assistant**.
   - Speak naturally in **Telugu (`te-IN`)**, **Hindi (`hi-IN`)**, or **Indian English (`en-IN`)**.
   - Real-time listening indicator, live speech wave, and live transcript visualizer.
   - Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice synthesis lets shopkeepers listen to structured confirmations aloud.

     - *"I need 1 oil packet, 2 tube lights and 5 soaps"*
   - Ranks stores by **Total Basket Cost** (not simply isolated cheapest items).
   - **Smart Split-Order Fallback (Option B):** If no single store has everything, the system calculates an optimal combination between two nearby shops.

   - *"కరెంట్ బిల్లు 450 రూపాయలు"* / *"बिजली का बिल 450 रुपये"* → Logs utility expense.
